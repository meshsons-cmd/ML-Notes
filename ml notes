Learning machine learning (ML) as a beginner can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down into structured steps makes it manageable. Hereâ€™s a solid roadmap:

1. Learn the Basics of Python
Since Python is the most popular language for ML, you should be comfortable with:

Variables, loops, functions
Lists, dictionaries, sets
NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
ðŸ“š Resources:

Python for Everybody â€“ Coursera (Free)
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python â€“ Free Book
2. Understand Mathematics for ML
You donâ€™t need to be a math expert, but you should grasp:

Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, dot product)
Probability & Statistics (mean, variance, Bayes' theorem)
Calculus (derivatives, gradientsâ€”mainly for deep learning)
ðŸ“š Resources:

Khan Academy â€“ Linear Algebra
Essence of Linear Algebra â€“ YouTube
StatQuest â€“ Statistics Explained Simply
3. Learn the Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Start with the three main types:

Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
Reinforcement Learning (Decision-making models)
ðŸ“š Resources:

Andrew Ngâ€™s ML Course â€“ Coursera (Great for conceptual understanding)
Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow â€“ Book (Highly recommended practical guide)
4. Get Hands-On with Scikit-Learn
Practice basic ML models with Python:

Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
Decision Trees, Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
K-Means Clustering
ðŸ“š Resources:

Scikit-Learn Documentation
Googleâ€™s Machine Learning Crash Course
ðŸ’» Practice on Kaggle: Kaggle has datasets and beginner-friendly projects.

5. Learn Deep Learning Basics (Optional)
Once you're comfortable with ML, explore deep learning:

Neural Networks (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs)
TensorFlow & PyTorch
